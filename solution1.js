// Print number from 1-10 using for loop

// To print number from 1-10 using for loop, we must understand the logic and how it actually works

// Step-1 (Write the normal code snippete like this below)

for(let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log("Number:",i);
}
// Here what i did above
// I just wrote the code snippet and as per the snippet. We have to decalare a cariable under the looping code, we can say the code "Let i = 1" is saying that i will have the value of 1 as usual declaration, Then we have to write at what point the loop is going to stop or end which is simply (i <= 10), advantage of using equals to with those comparison operators is it will particularly target the value nor just compare it in simple words it us going to stop at number 10, qand then the condition for increment or decrement as i++ which will increase 1 each time until the loop is stopped
